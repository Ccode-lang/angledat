# angledat
Angle data is a simple data type.

# Installing + using
Put `angledat.py` in the main dir of your project.  
Import it and use.

# Comments
Comments start with `$`.
# Data entry
```
<identifier> ^ <value>
```
`^` works as a data assigner, `identifier` is the value name, and `value` is the value.
